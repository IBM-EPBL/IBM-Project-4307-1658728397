Creating A Deep Learning Model For Classification Of Arrhythmia With 2-D ECG Spectral Image Representation
-----
In this project, we build an effective electrocardiogram (ECG) arrhythmia classification method using a convolutional neural network (CNN), in which we classify ECG into seven categories, one being normal and the other six being different types of arrhythmia using deep two-dimensional CNN with grayscale ECG images. We are creating a web application where the user selects the image which is to be classified. The image is fed into the model that is trained and the cited class will be displayed on the webpage. The web application is built using Python Flask.

>User interacts with User interface to upload image.<br>
Uploaded image is analyzed by the model which is integrated.<br>
Once model analyses the uploaded image, the prediction is showcased on the UI.<br>
